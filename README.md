# WWC RVA Pet Directory

## The unofficial pet directory of RVA Women Who Code
Has your dog promoted herself to WFH Office Manager?
Perhaps your cat has recently assumed the position of Regional Keyboard Warming Specialist?
If you've been working remotely, chances are likely that you have an office pet team behind you, and chances are HIGH that they deserve a formal introduction via our Women Who Code (Richmond VA Chapter) Pet Directory.

## Contributions encouraged!
Help build out our directory by adding a professional bio for your pet(s), or for the office pet you wish you had! Round out your bio by adding a photo, a job description, maybe some stats, an inspirational quote, whatever you like! Check out the Issues tab of this repo for additional ways to contribute - solving bugs, feature requests, etc.
